## Trust The Process

Here at Dove Design we have a process that we follow to ensure that our websites are designed to be interactive and easy to use. We use a process map to show how we work. The process map is a great way to show how we work and how we can help you.

### 1. Strategy & Content

In the initial phase we will kick off the project with a strategy session with your main stakeholders to align on the project goals, success matrix and challenges.

### 2. Design

Based on the selected visual approach and strategic goals agreed upon in the previous step, we will design a fully responsive website with design deliverables.

### 3. Development

We will develop the agreed design into a fully functional responsive website using the most up to date technologies such as Webflow that can be accessed throughout the build by the assigned stakeholders.

### 4. Launch

We will work with stakeholders to connect their website domain to the our hosting platform for the website to be live on the internet for everyone to view.

### 5. Training

Bespoke training & videos will be provided to all nominated staff on how to update the content within the website and how to use the CMS to add new content.

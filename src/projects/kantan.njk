          We contacted the team at Kantan regarding their current website setup as they wanted to 're-skin' the look and feel of the partners aspect of their current website, which was built using Squarespace.
        </p>

        <p>
          We designed the new pages in Figma, linking in with key stakeholders to review progress. Once the page designs were reviewed and accepted we developed the pages in Squarespace.

          It was a great project for us to work on and the team at Kantan were fantastic.

          We were approached by The Office Of The Durham Police, Crime & Victims
          Commissioner to create a website for their hate crime campaign titled
          Hate Hurts.
        </p>

        <p>
          We designed the website using Adobe XD and built using Webflow with
          the most up to date coding languages and included features such as
          Calendly to allow users to book appointments with officers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The campaign is to educate people about Hate Crime and the right of
          all to feel safe and comfortable in their community, whether itâ€™s
          where they live, work, visit, go to school, church, play or watch
          sport or socialise.
